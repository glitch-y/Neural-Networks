# Neural-Networks
This respository contains a number of proof of concepts for various types of neural network algorithms.
=== File descriptions ===

1. CNN_Image_Classification: the script uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog
2. GAN: the script uses a Generative Adversarial Network framework to generate new images
3. RNN: the script uses Recurrent Neural Networks to predict international airline passengers for a given month and year
4. VAE: the script uses a Variational Autoencoder to reconstruct the input data as accurately as possible
5. Clustering (K-Means): the script uses K-Means Clustering to classify wine data
